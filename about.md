I am a rising junior (third year) at Yale University broadly interested in all things language. In particular, my interest focuses on two seemingly disjoint topics: formal computational models of language, and the history of linguistic change. These fields might be respectively classified as computational linguistics and historical linguistics.

I am a member of [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://ling.yale.edu/research/computational-linguistics-yale-clay), a research group founded by [Bob Frank](http://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank) to build on the exciting progress that has been made in natural language processing (NLP) using theoretical insights from mathematical linguistics.
