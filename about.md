My name is Will, and I am a rising junior at Yale University broadly interested in the intersection of language and computation. In addition to studying things like formal languages and semantics, I'm quite into historical linguistics with a particular emphasis on medieval Germanic languages. Along with these interests of mine comes a fundamental appreciation for deep learning, and over the past two years I have been tinkering with neural models for language tasks, video game agents, and other random stuff (all the cool kids are doing it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

I am a member of [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/), a research group founded by [Bob Frank](http://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank) to build on the exciting progress that has been made applying deep learning to NLP problems.

Outside of school, I am an avid player and amateur developer of video games. I currently play a lot of Dota 2 and Age of Empires Online, and I am the captain of the Yale Dota 2 team. Along with my friend Toby, I'm working on completing my first serious video game title, [The Book of Thoth](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/), which will be released on Steam in 2018.

## Past research experience

I had the opportunity to do NLP research this summer at the Boston College [Language Learning Lab](http://l3atbc.org/) (L3) under the guidance of [Josh Hartshorne](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/psych/people/faculty/hartshorne.html) and [Sven Dietz](https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/lab/church/sdietz). My work at L3 focused on two main tasks: fluency assessment and native language inference from second-language text. While these two problems are collectively quite small, I grew to appreciate them both because of their practical importance (for teaching languages among other applications), and because we were able to develop some novel theoretically interesting methods to attack them using convolution, dependency parsing, and kernelized perceptrons.
