I am a rising junior (third year) at Yale University broadly interested in all things language. In particular, my interest focuses on two seemingly disjoint topics: formal computational models of language, and the history of linguistic change. These fields might be respectively classified as computational linguistics and historical linguistics.

I am a member of [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://ling.yale.edu/research/computational-linguistics-yale-clay), a research group founded by [Bob Frank](http://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank) to build on the exciting progress that has been made recently in natural language processing (NLP) by using theoretical insights from mathematical linguistics.

I also had the opportunity to do NLP research this summer at the Boston College [Language Learning Lab](http://l3atbc.org/) (L3) under the guidance of [Josh Hartshorne](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/psych/people/faculty/hartshorne.html) and [Sven Dietz](https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/lab/church/sdietz). My work at L3 focused on two main tasks: fluency assessment and native language inference from second-language text. While these two problems are collectively quite small, I grew to appreciate them both because they are practically important (for teaching languages among other applications), and because we were able to develop some novel theoretically interesting methods to attack them using convolution, dependency parsing, and kernelized perceptrons.

Additionally, I am an avid player and amateur developer of video games. I currently play a lot of Dota 2 and Age of Empires Online, and am working on completing my first serious title, The [Book of Thoth](https://github.com/SnorriDev/thoth), which will be released on Steam in 2018.
