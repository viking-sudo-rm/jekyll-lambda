I'm glad to announce that we have officially been approved to release The Book of Thoth on Steam. While working on the game this summer, Toby and I have have squashed many bugs and made several dramatic decisions to revamp the gameplay and graphics. I hope to share more of our progress with you soon, but it can be summarized as follows:
* Simplified multiworld
* More maps
* Better texture mending
* New professionally drawn animation set
* Ballistas
* Entity rotation
* Room-based levels
* Chaos-order dichotomy tech lines
