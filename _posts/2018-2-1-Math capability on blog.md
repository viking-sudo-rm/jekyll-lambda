I've integrated MathJax onto my blog so that I have the capability to display equations in LaTeX. For example, here is a description of the update rule for gradient descent:

$$ \theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} (\theta^t) $$

In case you're looking to do the same, I followed this [short tutorial](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html).
