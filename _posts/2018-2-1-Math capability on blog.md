I've integrated MathJax onto my blog so that I have the capability to display equations in LaTeX.

This post is a test to make sure that it works:

\[ \theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} (\theta) \]

In case you're looking to do the same, I followed this [short tutorial](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html).
