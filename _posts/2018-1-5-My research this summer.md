This summer, I had the opportunity to do NLP research at the Boston College [Language Learning Lab](http://l3atbc.org/) (L3) under the guidance of [Josh Hartshorne](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/psychology/people/faculty-directory/joshua-hartshorne.html) and [Sven Dietz](https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/lab/church/sdietz). My work at L3 focused on two main tasks: fluency assessment and native language inference from second-language text. These problems were cool both because of their practical importance (for teaching languages among other applications), and because I got to experiment with interesting methods to attack them like convolution, dependency parsing, and kernel classifiers.

It was a fun experience both working in the lab and living in Boston. Thanks to everyone at L3!
