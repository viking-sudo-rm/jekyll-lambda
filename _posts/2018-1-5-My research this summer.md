This summer, I had the opportunity to do NLP research at the Boston College [Language Learning Lab](http://l3atbc.org/) (L3) under the guidance of [Josh Hartshorne](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/psych/people/faculty/hartshorne.html) and [Sven Dietz](https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/lab/church/sdietz). My work at L3 focused on two main tasks: fluency assessment and native language inference from second-language text. I appreciated the opportunity to work on these problems both because of their practical importance (for teaching languages among other applications), and because the research gave me the opportunity to experiment with interesting methods to attack them like convolution, dependency parsing, and kernel classifiers.
