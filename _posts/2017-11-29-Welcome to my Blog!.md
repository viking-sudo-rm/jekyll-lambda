This is my personal blog. For more information about me or what I work on, check the links in the nav bar.

I used to post here frequently about my indie game *The Book of Thoth*. If you're looking for those posts, I've moved them to (the website for *The Book of Thoth*)[http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/].
