title: "What is The Book of Thoth?"
category: thoth
---

*The Book of Thoth* is a game that we at SnorriDev have been planning for the last year. The goal is to let our players experience and utilize magic more immersively than they thought was possible. We've done this by building a powerful spell language that players use to fight and solve puzzles. There are literally an infinite number of ways that you can put together the hieroglyphs you have unlocked to write spells. This dynamicism means that players need to be creative with the hieroglyphs that they know. It also means that many of the puzzles in our game have multiple solutions.

The story of *The Book of Thoth* is based off of a real legend from Ancient Egypt. Prince Setna is the main character, and his goal is to find the Book of Thoth: a legendary artifact that contains forbidden divine knowledge about spellcasting. If a mortal reads the tome, legend has it that they can become powerful enough to defeat a god in combat. Setna's journey takes him through many adventures in which he fights fellow humans, creatures of the underworld, and even the gods themselves.

You can follow the development of the project on this blog. We have already have approved to release the game on Steam, and our tentative release date is December 2017.
