An incomplete list of some open-source projects that I've worked on. For more, see [my GitHub](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/).

## Deep Learning
* [StackNN](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/StackNN). Public implementation of the differentiable stack datastructure originally described by Grefenstette et al., 2015.
* [Voynich2Vec](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/voynich2vec). Word embedding techniques applied to deciphering the mysterious Voynich manuscript. We found evidence that certain suffices seem to have morphosyntactically meaningful distribution.
* [DeepMusic](https://github.com/jweinstein2/DeepMusic). A generative model for composing harmonic music from a single example song.
* [DiachronicPOSTagger](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/DiachronicPOSTagger). A part of speech tagger that models syntactic change over time. We were able to show that the year embeddings in this network were encoding a linguistic progression between nearby years.
* [Draftnet](http://draftnet.herokuapp.com/). Named Grace Hopper Prize finalist for deep learning model that drafts winning teams in Dota 2. Developed a web interface for the model after the competition (see above link).

## Game Development
* [The Book of Thoth](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/). A game set in Ancient Egypt where players solve puzzles with dynamic hieroglyphic spells, which are parsed by a natural-language interpreter. Approved for 2018 publication on Steam.
* [Frisbee Warfare](https://www.facebook.com/Frisbee-Mayhem-fShargle-Warfare-409693082412612). A horde-mode first person shooter where players use frisbees instead of guns. I was inspired to make this game after playing a lot of frisbee dodgeball one summer.

## Web and App Development
* [Franklin Warranty Center](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/franklin-warranty-center/id1320465677?mt=8). An app for reporting car insurance claims that I made as a freelance developer.
* [Foodie Call](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/yale-foodie-call/id1229515342?mt=8). An app and website for Yale students to order late night food from local restaurants straight to their dorm rooms.

## Minecraft Mods
* [XRayField](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BOOAECXTDoWGliaWF0dE9xSUk/view). Minecraft mod that computes work integrals of mining trajectories through a "diamond field" in order to find cheaters. This was my high school final project.
* [Bounty](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bounty-snorri). A Bukkit plugin that lets players on a Minecraft server put cash bounties on each other's heads.
* WanderCraft. A single-player Star Wars Minecraft mod with x-wings, throwable lightsabers, and lots of other custom content.

## Cryptography
* [Unfair Vigenere](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/UnfairVigenere). A Java program that breaks Vigenere ciphers via chi-squared analysis of character frequency distributions.

## Other
* Demeter Backup Utility. In 7th grade, I made an app for my school's tech department that allowed students to upload assignments to the school's server. I got a patent for the technology.
