	<p>I am an incoming research resident on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>. I recently finished my BS in Linguistics and Computer Science at Yale, where my <a href="/files/senior-thesis/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> was advised by <a href="https://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank">Bob Frank</a> and <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dana-angluin">Dana Angluin</a>.
	</p>

	<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of language and computation. With both a theoretical and practical focus, I have worked on the following topics:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>How can linguistics and formal language theory inform the interpretability of neural networks?</li>
		<li>What can deep learning reveal about ancient languages and language change?</li>
		<li>Deep learning and video games.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Outside of class, I was the captain of the Yale Dota 2 team. I also created an indie video game called <a href="http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/">the Book of Thoth</a> and enjoy rap, hiking, and basketball.</p>
