Thanks for visiting my blog! I am a junior at Yale University broadly interested in the intersection of language and computation. This means both practical NLP and more theoretical issues in linguistics. Along with these interests comes a fundamental appreciation for deep learning, and over the past two years I have been tinkering with neural networks for language tasks, video games, and other applications. I also like historical linguistics, with a particular focus on medieval Germanic languages.

I am a member of [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/), a research group founded by [Bob Frank](http://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank) to build on the exciting progress that has been made applying deep learning to NLP problems. Last semester, I was an undergraduate learning assistant (ULA) for [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/)'s artificial intelligence course in the fall of 2017.

Outside of school, I am an avid player and amateur developer of video games. I currently play a lot of Dota 2 and Age of Empires Online, and I captain the Yale Dota 2 team. I got into game programming at a young age from making Minecraft mods and Unity games. Along with my friend Toby, I'm working on completing my first serious video game title, [*The Book of Thoth*](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/), which will be released on Steam in 2018.
