Thanks for visiting my website! I am a junior at Yale University interested in language and computation. More specifically, I have worked on projects concerning the following questions:
* How can linguistics and formal language theory inform the development of sophisticated deep architectures for NLP?
* Can we use apply deep methods to language decipherment and other historical linguistic problems?
* Video games. Deep learning?

Outside of school, I play and amateurly develop video games. I'm a fan of Dota 2 and Age of Empires Online, and I captain the Yale Dota 2 team. Along with my friend Toby, I'm working on completing my first serious indie project, [*The Book of Thoth*](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/).
