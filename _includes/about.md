Thanks for visiting my website! I am a junior at Yale University interested in the intersection of language and computation. More specifically, I have worked on projects investigating the following questions:
* How can linguistics and formal language theory inform the development of more sophisticated deep architectures for language tasks?
* Can we use apply deep methods to language decipherment and other historical linguistic problems?
* Video games. Deep learning?

I am a member of [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/), a group founded by [Bob Frank](http://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank) that focuses on deep learning for computational linguistics. Last semester, I was an undergraduate learning assistant (ULA) for [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/)'s AI course. I will be ULAing for his spring NLP class.

Outside of school, I am an avid player and amateur developer of video games. I currently play a lot of Dota 2 and Age of Empires Online, and I captain the Yale Dota 2 team. I got into game programming at a young age from making Minecraft mods and Unity games. Along with my friend Toby, I'm working on completing my first serious video game title, [*The Book of Thoth*](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/), which will (hopefully) be released on Steam in 2018.
