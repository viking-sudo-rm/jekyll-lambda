Will Merrill is a junior at Yale University interested in the intersection language and computation. This includes the formal foundations of linguistic structure, dynamics of historical change, and computational challenges in building sophisticated NLP systems. He has worked on research concerning the following questions:

* How can linguistics and formal language theory inform the development of sophisticated deep architectures for NLP?
* How can deep learning be applied to language decipherment and other historical linguistic problems?
* Can deep learning and reinforcement learning allow artificial agents to learn sophisticated computer games?

Outside of class, Will is the captain of the Yale Dota 2 team and a member of Yale Table Tennis. He is also creating an indie video game project called [*The Book of Thoth*](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/) and enjoys listening to rap.
