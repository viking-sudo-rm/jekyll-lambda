An incomplete list of some stuff I've written that I think is cool.

### Minecraft mods
* [XRayField](https://www.google.com/search?q=xrayfield+bukkit&oq=xrayfield+bukkit&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.2230j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Uses vector calculus to probabilistically catch cheaters on Minecraft servers. I like this project a lot because I think the theory behind it is really elegant, and it actually works really well in practice.
* [Bounty](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bounty-snorri). A Bukkit plugin that lets players on a Minecraft server put cash bounties on each other's heads.
