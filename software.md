An incomplete list of some open-source projects that I've worked on.

# Machine learning
* [Draftnet](http://draftnet.herokuapp.com/). A neural network-powered aid for drafting in the popular video game Dota 2.

# Minecraft mods
* [XRayField](https://www.google.com/search?q=xrayfield+bukkit&oq=xrayfield+bukkit&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.2230j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Uses vector calculus to probabilistically catch cheaters on Minecraft servers. I like this project a lot because the theory behind it is really elegant.
* [Bounty](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bounty-snorri). A Bukkit plugin that lets players on a Minecraft server put cash bounties on each other's heads.
