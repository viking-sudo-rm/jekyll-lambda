An incomplete list of some open-source projects that I've worked on. For more, see [my GitHub](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/).

## Machine learning
* [Draftnet](http://draftnet.herokuapp.com/). Named Grace Hopper Prize finalist for deep learning model that drafts winning teams in Dota 2. Developed a web interface for the model after the competition (see above link).

## Game development
* [The Book of Thoth](http://snorridev.github.io/thoth/). A game set in Ancient Egypt where players solve puzzles with dynamic hieroglyphic spells, which are parsed by a natural-language interpreter. Approved for 2018 publication on Steam.

## Cryptography
* [UnfairVigenere](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/UnfairVigenere). A Java program that breaks Vigenere ciphers via chi-squared analysis of character frequency distributions.

## Minecraft mods
* [XRayField](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BOOAECXTDoWGliaWF0dE9xSUk/view). Minecraft mod that computes work integrals of mining trajectories through a "diamond field" in order to find cheaters. This was my high school final project.
* [Bounty](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bounty-snorri). A Bukkit plugin that lets players on a Minecraft server put cash bounties on each other's heads.
* WanderCraft. A single-player Star Wars Minecraft mod with x-wings, throwable lightsabers, and lots of other custom content.
